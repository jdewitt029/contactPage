 Jordan DeWitt is a digital artist from a town called Tracy, located in the valley of California. His initial passion in life was sports, particularly basketball, until his third year of community college. At San Joaquin Delta College, Jordan was introduced to a digital art class in which he was introduced to the software Adobe Photoshop, thus, beginning his love for digital art. After receiving his associate's degree, he transferred to San Jose State University and enrolled in the Digital Media Art (DMA) program. In DMA, he was introduced to a wide variety of digital art making processes, programs, and software. Incorporating these different programs, he likes to create mixed media artworks to try and uplift anyone viewing the artworks he creates.
Jordan cherishes his Christian faith and this has helped him develop the different values he believes in today. As an artist, he usually tries to create artworks that are meant to be uplifting as he is a rather positive person and wants others to share in some of his positive outlooks on life. He is also very interested in the soul and spirituality. He has created a few artworks with these themes and will continue to do so in the future, as he thinks the inner soul is essential for the inner peace that humans long for. After graduating from San Jose State University, Jordan intends to use his art to continue to uplift and encourage others. He also plans on writing and creating music alongside his twin brother to collaborate on dynamic pieces of art that incorporate music, video, and significant messages.
